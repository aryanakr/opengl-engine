This Helicopter model is textured in blender 2.8 (File included).
Since the project textuer loader assumes UV are fliped, texture files are vertically flipped using Adobe Photoshop and the original texture files are in TexturesBackup folder.
In order to load the textures and the model correctly in blender, replace images in aforementioned folder here.
Remember to flip or revert the files to lead the model inside the assignment project.
